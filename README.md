# Project-Workflow-Commande-distribution
Distribution at Gourmandise: placing orders starting from points of sale to Centrale and finally to workshops and suppliers.
In this shared part of the project we find: the integration of the model illustrated on the Flowable tool BPMN2.0, the link with a MySQL database, the development of APIs for management of orders: Approve or reject an order by a central group agent coming from the PV group agent.
